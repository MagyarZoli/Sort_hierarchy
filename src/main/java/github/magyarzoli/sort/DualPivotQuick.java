     * <b>Dual Pivot Quick Sort:</b><br>
     * Dual Pivot Quick Sort is an enhanced version of the traditional Quick Sort algorithm that uses
     * two pivot values to partition the array instead of one.
     * This modification improves the efficiency of the sorting algorithm,
     * especially when dealing with arrays that contain many duplicate elements.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>the traditional Quick Sort, a single pivot element is selected, usually from the middle of the array.
     *     In Dual Pivot Quick Sort, two pivot elements, called pivot1 and pivot2, are chosen.
     *     These pivot values are typically selected from different parts of the array, such as the first and last elements.</li>
     *     <li>The array is divided into three sections based on the pivot values.
     *     All elements less than pivot1 are placed to the left,
     *     all elements greater than pivot2 are placed to the right,
     *     and elements between pivot1 and pivot2 are placed in the middle.</li>
     *     <li>After partitioning the array, three subarrays are created:
     *     the left section, the middle section, and the right section.
     *     The Dual Pivot Quick Sort algorithm is then recursively applied to these subarrays.</li>
     *     <li>The left section contains elements smaller than pivot1.
     *     The Dual Pivot Quick Sort is called recursively on this section.</li>
     *     <li>The middle section contains elements between pivot1 and pivot2. If the middle section is non-empty,
     *     the Dual Pivot Quick Sort is called recursively on this section.</li>
     *     <li>The right section contains elements greater than pivot2.
     *     The Dual Pivot Quick Sort is called recursively on this section.</li>
     *     <li>Once the recursive sorting calls return, the subarrays are already sorted.
     *     The algorithm then combines these sorted subarrays to produce the final sorted array.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * By using two pivot values and dividing the array into three sections,
     * the Dual Pivot Quick Sort algorithm achieves better performance than the traditional Quick Sort algorithm,
     * especially for arrays with many duplicate elements.
     * It reduces the number of comparisons and swaps required, leading to faster sorting times.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(log(n))</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>No</b>
