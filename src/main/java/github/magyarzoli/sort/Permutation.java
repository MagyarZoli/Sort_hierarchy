     * <b>Permutation Sort:</b><br>
     * Is a simple but inefficient sorting algorithm that works by generating all possible permutations
     * of an array and selecting the one that is in sorted order. While conceptually straightforward, this approach
     * leads
     * to a high time complexity and is not practical for sorting large arrays.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Generate Permutations for an array of {@code n} elements, Permutation Sort generates all {@code n!}
     *     permutations of the array. It does this by swapping elements in different positions recursively until all
     *     possible arrangements are generated.</li>
     *     <li>Check for Sorted Permutation for each generated permutation, the algorithm checks whether the current
     *     permutation is sorted in ascending order.</li>
     *     <li>Select Sorted Permutation when a sorted permutation is found, the algorithm stops and considers that
     *     permutation as the sorted arrangement of the array.</li>
     *     <li>Replace Original Array the sorted permutation is then copied back to the original array, replacing the
     *     original unsorted array.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * The main problem with Permutation Sort is its extremely high time complexity. The algorithm generates <em>n!</em>
     * permutations and checks each permutation for sortedness, which makes the overall time complexity of
     * Permutation Sort <em>O(n! * n)</em>, where n is the number of elements in the array. This makes it highly
     * impractical for even moderately sized arrays because the number of operations grows factorially with the size
     * of the array.<br><br>
     * While the idea of Permutation Sort might be intuitive, its inefficiency makes it unsuitable for practical
     * sorting tasks. It serves more as a theoretical example to demonstrate the importance of optimizing sorting
     * algorithms for real-world scenarios.<br><br>
     * Permutation Sort is inherently stable because it only swaps elements within the array and doesn't involve any
     * comparison between elements. If two elements are equal, they will remain in the same relative order after the
     * permutation operations.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em> O(n! * n)</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em> O(n! * n)</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em> O(n! * n)</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(n)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>Yes</b>
