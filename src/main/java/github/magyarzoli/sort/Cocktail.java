     * <b>Cocktail Sort:</b><br>
     * Also known as Cocktail Shaker Sort or Bidirectional Bubble Sort, is a variation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
     * It works by repeatedly moving through the list in both directions, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
     * This bidirectional movement helps to optimize the sorting process by sorting the largest and smallest elements simultaneously.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Start with an unsorted list of elements.</li>
     *     <li>Set two pointers, {@code start} and {@code end}, initially pointing to the first and last elements of the list, respectively.</li>
     *     <li>Repeat the following steps until no more swaps are made:</li>
     *     <li>Move the {@code start} pointer from left to right, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.</li>
     *     <li>If any swaps are made during this pass, mark that a swap occurred.</li>
     *     <li>Move the {@code end} pointer from right to left, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.</li>
     *     <li>If any swaps are made during this pass, mark that a swap occurred.</li>
     *     <li>If no swaps occurred during the entire pass (both from {@code start} to {@code end} and from {@code end} to {@code start}),
     *     the list is already sorted, and the algorithm can terminate.</li>
     *     <li>The sorted list is obtained once the algorithm terminates.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * Cocktail Sort differs from the traditional Bubble Sort by introducing the bidirectional movement.
     * This bidirectional traversal helps to improve the efficiency of the algorithm by bringing both
     * the largest and smallest elements closer to their correct positions with each pass.<br><br>
     * Cocktail Sort has a time complexity of <em>O(n^2)</em> in the average and worst cases,
     * where <em>n</em> is the number of elements in the list. Although it has the same time complexity as Bubble Sort,
     * Cocktail Sort tends to perform better in practice due to the bidirectional movement.
     * However, it is still considered relatively inefficient for large datasets.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(1)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>Yes</b>

     * {@code cocktail} method takes a list {@code list} of type {@link java.lang.Comparable Comparable},
     * an integer {@code left} representing the left index, an integer {@code right} representing the right index,
     * and an instance of the {@code SortFunctional<Comparable>} interface as parameters.
     * <ul>
     *     <li>It initializes a boolean variable {@code swapped} to {@code true} to indicate that a swap has occurred.</li>
     *     <li>It initializes two integer variables: {@code start} as the left index and {@code end} as {@code (right - 1)}.</li>
     *     <li>The method enters a while loop that continues as long as {@code swapped} is {@code true}.
     *     This loop performs one pass of the cocktail sort algorithm.</li>
     *     <li>Inside the loop, it sets {@code swapped} to {@code false} before each pass.</li>
     *     <li>It uses a for loop to iterate from start to end (left to right).
     *     Inside this loop, it calls the {@code isSwap} method to determine
     *     if a swap is needed between the elements at indices {@code i} and {@code (i + 1)}.
     *     If a swap is required, it sets {@code swapped} to {@code true}.</li>
     *     <li>After the forward pass, it checks if {@code swapped} is still {@code false}.
     *     If so, it breaks out of the loop since no swaps were made, and the list is already sorted.</li>
     *     <li>It sets {@code swapped} back to {@code false} before the backward pass.</li>
     *     <li>It uses a for loop to iterate from {@code (end - 1)} to {@code start} (right to left).
     *     Inside this loop, it again calls the {@code isSwap} method to determine
     *     if a swap is needed between the elements at indices {@code i} and {@code (i + 1)}.
     *     If a swap is required, it sets {@code swapped} to {@code true}.</li>
     *     <li>After the backward pass, it increments {@code start} by <i>1</i>,
     *     indicating that the elements at the left end are already sorted.</li>
     *     <li>The process continues until no swaps are made in either the forward or backward pass,
     *     indicating that the list is fully sorted.</li>
     * </ul>
     * {@code cocktail} method combines the concepts of bubble sort and selection sort by traversing the list bidirectionally,
     * repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are out of order.
     * This process continues until the list becomes fully sorted.
     * @param       list to be arranged.
     * @param       left the value in the list must be smaller than a {@code right} parameter.
     * @param       right the value in the list must be greater than a {@code left} parameter.
     * @param       functional lambda expression for comparison.
     * @see         SortSwap#isSwap(List, int, int, SortFunctional)
