     * <b>Pancake Sort:</b><br>
     * Pancake Sort is a sorting algorithm that aims to sort an array of elements in ascending or descending order.
     * It gets its name from the analogy of flipping pancakes with a spatula to sort them.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Start with the entire array of elements to be sorted.</li>
     *     <li>Find the index of the maximum (or minimum, depending on the desired order) element in the unsorted portion of the array.
     *     This is typically done by iterating over the unsorted portion of the array and keeping track of
     *     the index with the maximum (or minimum) value.</li>
     *     <li>Once the maximum (or minimum) element is found, the following steps are performed:</li>
     *     <li>If the maximum (or minimum) element is already at the rightmost position in the unsorted portion,
     *     no action is required for this iteration.</li>
     *     <li>If the maximum (or minimum) element is not at the rightmost position,
     *     perform a flip operation to move it to the beginning of the unsorted portion.
     *     This is done by reversing the order of elements from the start of the array up to
     *     the position of the maximum (or minimum) element.</li>
     *     <li>Perform a flip operation to move the maximum (or minimum) element from its current position at
     *     the beginning of the unsorted portion to the end of the sorted portion.
     *     This is done by reversing the order of elements from the start of the array up to the end of the unsorted portion.</li>
     *     <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the remaining unsorted portion of the array until the entire array is sorted.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * Pancake Sort essentially works by identifying the maximum (or minimum) element in each iteration and
     * using a combination of flipping operations to move it to its correct position in the sorted portion of the array.
     * The number of iterations required depends on the size and order of the array.<br><br>
     * It's worth noting that Pancake Sort has a worst-case time complexity of <em>O(n^2)</em>,
     * where n is the number of elements in the array.
     * However, it can be optimized to <em>O(n log(n))</em> by using a data structure such as a
     * heap to efficiently find the maximum (or minimum) element in each iteration.<br><br>
     * Pancake Sort is stable, meaning that elements with equal values retain their relative order after sorting.
     * If two elements have the same value, their order in the original array will be preserved in the sorted array.
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n)</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(1)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>Yes</b>
