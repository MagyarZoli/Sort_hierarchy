     * <b>Odd-even (Brick) Sort:</b><br>
     * The Odd-even Sort algorithm is a variation of the Bubble Sort algorithm that is specifically designed to sort
     * arrays in parallel.
     * It works by comparing and swapping adjacent elements in pairs repeatedly until the array is sorted.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Start with an unsorted array of elements.</li>
     *     <li>Repeat the following steps until the array is sorted:</li>
     *     <li>Compare and swap adjacent elements in pairs, starting from the first and second elements.</li>
     *     <li>Compare and swap adjacent elements in pairs, starting from the second and third elements.</li>
     *     <li>Continue alternating between odd and even adjacent element comparisons and swaps until the last pair of
     *     elements.</li>
     *     <li>After each iteration, the largest element in the unsorted portion of the array will move to its correct
     *     position at the end.</li>
     *     <li>Repeat the above steps until the entire array is sorted.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * The odd-even sort algorithm works well for parallel computing because
     * the comparisons and swaps can be performed independently on different pairs of elements.
     * However, it is not as efficient as some other sorting algorithms,
     * and it has a worst-case time complexity of <em>O(n^2)</em>, where n is the number of elements to be
     * sorted.<br><br>
     * Transposition sort is a stable sorting algorithm.
     * This means that it maintains the relative order of elements with equal values during the sorting process.
     * If two elements have the same value,
     * the algorithm will not swap them unless their relative order is disturbed by other adjacent elements.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(1)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>Yes</b>
