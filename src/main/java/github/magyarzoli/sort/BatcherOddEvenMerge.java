     * <b>Batcher's Odd-even Merge Sort:</b><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * Is a parallel sorting algorithm that combines the odd-even transposition sort and
     * the batcher's merge algorithm to achieve efficient sorting.
     * It is designed to take advantage of parallel processing capabilities in order to speed up the sorting
     * process.<br>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Divide the array: The algorithm begins by dividing the input array into smaller subarrays.
     *     Each subarray is assigned to a processing element or a thread for parallel processing.</li>
     *     <li>Odd-even transposition sort: Within each processing element, the subarray is sorted using the odd-even
     *     transposition sort algorithm.
     *     This algorithm compares and swaps adjacent elements in pairs,
     *     iteratively performing odd-even comparisons and transpositions until the subarray is sorted locally.</li>
     *     <li>Odd-even merge: After the odd-even transposition sort phase, the sorted subarrays need to be merged to
     *     obtain the globally sorted array.
     *     This is done using the batcher's merge algorithm, which merges pairs of adjacent subarrays in a parallel
     *     manner.</li>
     *     <li>Recursive merge: The merging step is performed recursively until all subarrays are merged into a single
     *     sorted array.
     *     This process involves repeatedly merging adjacent pairs of subarrays until the final sorted array is
     *     obtained.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * The Odd-even Merge Sort algorithm leverages parallelism by sorting and merging subarrays concurrently.
     * This parallelism can be achieved using multiple processing elements, threads, or parallel computing
     * techniques.<br><br>
     * Batcher's odd-even merge sort has a complexity of <em>O(n log^2(n))</em>, where n is the number of elements in
     * the input array.
     * It offers better scalability and potential speedup compared to traditional sorting algorithms
     * like quicksort or mergesort when executed on parallel computing architectures.<br><br>
     * It's worth noting that the efficiency and performance of Batcher's Odd-even Merge Sort
     * depend on factors such as the underlying parallel processing capabilities,
     * the size of the input array, and the specific implementation details of the algorithm and its supporting
     * operations.<br><br>
     * Stability: Batcher's Odd-even Merge Sort is a stable sorting algorithm.
     * This means that it preserves the relative order of elements with equal values during the sorting process.
     * If there are multiple elements with the same value,
     * the algorithm ensures that their original order is maintained in the sorted output.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n log^2(n))</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n log^2(n))</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n log^2(n))</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(n)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>Yes</b>
