     * <b>Merge In Place Sort:</b><br>
     * Is a variant of the merge sort algorithm that performs the sorting operation directly on the input array,
     * without using any additional arrays for merging.
     * It achieves this by carefully manipulating the elements within the original array during the merging process.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>The algorithm recursively divides the array into smaller subarrays until each subarray contains only one element (considered sorted).</li>
     *     <li>Then, it starts merging the subarrays in pairs, using an in-place merging technique.</li>
     *     <li>To perform an in-place merge of two subarrays, the algorithm follows these steps:</li>
     *     <ul>
     *         <li> It compares the first element of the left subarray with the first element of the right subarray.
     *         If the left element is greater, it swaps the two elements.</li>
     *         <li>After the swap, it compares the new first element of the right subarray with the next element in the left subarray,
     *         and so on, until the elements in both subarrays are in the correct sorted order.</li>
     *         <li>Meanwhile, the elements in the left subarray are shifted one position to the right to make space for
     *         the swapped element from the right subarray.</li>
     *     </ul>
     *     <li>Once the merging of two subarrays is complete, the algorithm moves on to merge the next pair of subarrays,
     *     until the entire array is sorted.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * Time Complexity of above approach is <em>O(n^2 * log(n))</em> because merge is <em>O(n^2)</em>.
     * Time complexity of standard merge sort is less, <em>O(n log(n))</em>.
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(n)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>Yes</b>
