     * <b>Cocktail Sort:</b><br>
     * Also known as Cocktail Shaker Sort or Bidirectional Bubble Sort, is a variation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
     * It works by repeatedly moving through the list in both directions, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
     * This bidirectional movement helps to optimize the sorting process by sorting the largest and smallest elements simultaneously.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Start with an unsorted list of elements.</li>
     *     <li>Set two pointers, {@code start} and {@code end}, initially pointing to the first and last elements of the list, respectively.</li>
     *     <li>Repeat the following steps until no more swaps are made:</li>
     *     <ul>
     *         <li>Move the {@code start} pointer from left to right, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.</li>
     *         <li>If any swaps are made during this pass, mark that a swap occurred.</li>
     *         <li>Move the {@code end} pointer from right to left, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.</li>
     *         <li>If any swaps are made during this pass, mark that a swap occurred.</li>
     *         <li>If no swaps occurred during the entire pass (both from {@code start} to {@code end} and from {@code end} to {@code start}),
     *         the list is already sorted, and the algorithm can terminate.</li>
     *     </ul>
     *     <li>The sorted list is obtained once the algorithm terminates.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * Cocktail Sort differs from the traditional Bubble Sort by introducing the bidirectional movement.
     * This bidirectional traversal helps to improve the efficiency of the algorithm by bringing both
     * the largest and smallest elements closer to their correct positions with each pass.<br><br>
     * Cocktail Sort has a time complexity of <em>O(n^2)</em> in the average and worst cases,
     * where <em>n</em> is the number of elements in the list. Although it has the same time complexity as Bubble Sort,
     * Cocktail Sort tends to perform better in practice due to the bidirectional movement.
     * However, it is still considered relatively inefficient for large datasets.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(1)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>Yes</b>
