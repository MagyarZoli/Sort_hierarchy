     * <b>Smooth Heap Sort:</b><br>
     * It is another version of heapsort that is designed to minimize the number of comparisons performed during the sort.
     * Like heapsort, smooth sort sorts an array by building a heap and repeatedly extracting the maximum element.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>The first {@code for} loop iterates over the elements of the array. For each element, it
     *     adds a new element to a heap structure stored in the array and ensures that the heap property is maintained after the insertion.</li>
     *     <li>After the first loop completes, the {@code buffer} contains all the elements from the {@code array} in a heap structure.</li>
     *     <li>The second {@code for} loop iterates over the indices of the {@code array}. For each index {@code i}, it calls
     *     the deletes the minimum element from a heap structure stored in the {@code buffer} array and ensures that
     *     the heap property is maintained after the deletion.</li>
     *     <li>At the end, the {@code array} will contain the elements sorted in increasing order.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * Like Heapsort, Smooth Sort is an in-place algorithm with an upper bound of <em>O(n log(n))</em>, but it is not a stable sort.
     * The advantage of Smooth Sort is that it comes closer to <em>O(n)</em> time if the input is already sorted to some degree,
     * whereas heapsort averages <em>O(n log(n))</em> regardless of the initial sorted state.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n)</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(n)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>No</b>
