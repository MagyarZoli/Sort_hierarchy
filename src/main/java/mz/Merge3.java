     * <b>Merge3 Sort:</b><br>
     * The sorting process is divided into three parts and performed incrementally.
     * The idea behind this approach is to split the input array into three roughly equal parts and recursively sort each part separately.
     * Then, the sorted parts are merged together to obtain the final sorted array.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Divide the input range into three parts by calculating two midpoints.
     *     These midpoints split the range into three roughly equal parts.</li>
     *     <li>Recursively sort each part using.
     *     This method is called four times to sort the left, middle, and right parts of the range, as well as to merge the sorted parts together.</li>
     *     <li>The performs the actual sorting and merging operations.
     *     completes, the sorted elements are stored in a temporary buffer array.
     *     Finally, the sorted elements are copied back from the buffer array to the original array.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * Merge3 Sort customized or adapted version of merge sort with sorting and merging steps.
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(n)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>Yes</b>
