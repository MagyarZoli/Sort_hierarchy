     * <b>Ternary Heap Sort:</b><br>
     * Which uses a ternary heap instead of a binary heap; that is, each element in the heap has three children.
     * Ternary Heap Sort is somewhat more complicated to program, but it is potentially faster.
     * Each step in the sift operation of a ternary heap requires three comparisons and one swap,
     * whereas in a binary heap two comparisons and one swap are required.
     * The ternary heap can do two steps in less time than the binary heap requires for three steps.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Build a binary heap from the input array. This is done by starting with the last parent node in the array
     *     and repeatedly {@code heapify} the array to satisfy the heap property.</li>
     *     <li>{@code heapify} is a process where the element at index i is compared with its children, and if necessary,
     *     swapped to maintain the heap property (max-heap or min-heap).</li>
     *     <li>This process is performed for all parent nodes, starting from the last parent down to the root.</li>
     *     <li>Once the binary heap is constructed, repeatedly extract the maximum (or minimum)
     *     element from the heap and place it at the end of the array.</li>
     *     <li>Swap the root element (which is the maximum or minimum element depending on whether it's a max-heap or min-heap)
     *     with the last element of the heap.</li>
     *     <li>Reduce the size of the heap by one.</li>
     *     <li>Perform {@code heapify} on the root to restore the heap property.</li>
     *     <li>Repeat step 2 until all elements have been extracted from the heap. The extracted elements will be in the reverse order for
     *     a max-heap (sorted in ascending order) or in the correct order for a min-heap (sorted in descending order).</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * Thus, because of the <em>O(n log(n))</em> upper bound on heapsort's running time and constant upper bound on its auxiliary storage,
     * embedded systems with real-time constraints or systems concerned with security often use heapsort.
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(n)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>No</b>
