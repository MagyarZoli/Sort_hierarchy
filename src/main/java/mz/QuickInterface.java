     * {@code partitionDualDec} It partitions an array of elements {@code array} between the indices {@code left} and {@code right} (inclusive)
     * and returns an array of two integers representing the indices of the pivots after the partitioning.
     * <ul>
     *     <li>The {@link java.lang.SuppressWarnings @SuppressWarnings}{@code ("unchecked")} annotation is used to suppress compiler
     *     warnings related to unchecked type casting when using the {@link java.lang.Comparable#compareTo(Object) compareTo} method.
     *     This annotation is not directly related to the functionality of the method but rather a way to handle warnings.</li>
     *     <li>The first step compares the elements at indices {@code left} and {@code right}
     *     and swaps them if the element at {@code left} is greater than the element at {@code right}.
     *     This ensures that the {@code pivot1} (the leftmost pivot) is smaller than or equal to {@code pivot2} (the rightmost pivot).</li>
     *     <li>The variables {@code newLeft}, {@code newRight}, and {@code selectIndex} are initialized.
     *     {@code newLeft} points to the index after the {@code pivot1}, {@code newRight} points to
     *     the index before {@code pivot2}, and {@code selectIndex} starts from the index after the left pivot.</li>
     *     <li>The algorithm enters a while loop that continues until {@code selectIndex} surpasses {@code newRight}.</li>
     *     <li>Inside the loop, the algorithm checks if the element at {@code selectIndex} is greater than {@code pivot1}. If it is,
     *     the element is swapped with the element at {@code newLeft}, and {@code newLeft} is incremented by 1.</li>
     *     <li>If the element at {@code selectIndex} is not greater than {@code pivot1}, the algorithm checks if it is smaller than or equal to {@code pivot2}.
     *     If it is, the algorithm enters another loop that finds an element from the right side of the partition that is greater than or equal to {@code pivot2}.
     *     This loop decrements {@code newRight} until it finds such an element or until {@code selectIndex} surpasses {@code newRight}.</li>
     *     <li>Once the element is found, the element at {@code selectIndex} is swapped with the found element, and {@code newRight} is decremented by 1.
     *     Then, if the element at {@code selectIndex} is greater than {@code pivot1},
     *     the element is swapped with the element at {@code newLeft}, and {@code newLeft} is incremented by 1.</li>
     *     <li>Finally, {@code selectIndex} is incremented by 1, and the while loop continues until {@code selectIndex} surpasses {@code newRight}.</li>
     *     <li>After the loop finishes, the left pivot {@code pivot1} is swapped with the element at {@code newLeft - 1}, and the right pivot {@code pivot2} is swapped with the element at {@code newRight + 1}.
     *     This step puts the pivots in their correct positions.</li>
