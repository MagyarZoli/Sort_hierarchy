     * <b>Weak Heap Sort:</b><br>
     * Construction uses a buffer that supports constant-time insertion.
     * A new element is inserted into the buffer as long as the buffer size is below a threshold.
     * Once the buffer is full, all the elements of the buffer are moved to the weak heap.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>The root node has no left child</li>
     *     <li>For every node, the value associated with that node is greater than or equal to
     *     the values associated with all nodes in its right subtree.</li>
     *     <li>The leaves of the tree have heights that are all within one of each other.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * Weak heaps were introduced as part of a variant heap sort algorithm that (unlike the standard heap sort using binary heaps)
     * could be used to sort n items using only <em>O(n log(n))</em> comparisons.
     * They were later investigated as a more generally applicable priority queue data structure.<br><br>
     * In a weak max-heap, the maximum value can be found (in constant time) as the value associated with the root node; similarly
     * in a weak min-heap, the minimum value can be found at the root.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(n)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>No</b>
