    /**
     * <b>Tim Sort:</b><br>
     * Is a hybrid sorting algorithm that combines the strengths of Merge Sort and Insertion Sort to achieve efficient and stable sorting.
     * The default sorting algorithm in Java's {@link java.util.Arrays#sort(Object[]) Arrays.sort()} method.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Insertion Sort: Tim Sort starts by dividing the input array into small chunks or "runs."
     *     It uses Insertion Sort to sort these runs individually.
     *     Insertion Sort is chosen for small chunks because it performs well on already partially sorted data.</li>
     *     <li>Merge Step: After the runs are sorted, Tim Sort begins merging them.
     *     It repeatedly merges pairs of runs into larger sorted runs until there is only one run remaining.
     *     The merging process is similar to the merge step in Merge Sort.</li>
     *     <li>Run Size Determination: Tim Sort employs a concept called "galloping" to determine the size of runs during the merging process.
     *     It dynamically adjusts the run size based on the distribution of the data, aiming to minimize the number of comparisons and movements.
     *     This adaptive nature of Tim Sort allows it to adapt to different types of input data.</li>
     *     <li>Stability: Tim Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that it preserves the relative order of elements with equal values.
     *     It ensures that equal elements maintain their original order during the sorting process.</li>
     *     <li>Optimization Techniques: Tim Sort incorporates various optimizations to improve performance.
     *     These include the use of a temporary buffer array during merging,
     *     reducing the number of comparisons by exploiting sorted subsequences, and minimizing data movements.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * Tim Sort is designed to perform well on various types of real-world data, including arrays with a mix of already sorted and unsorted elements,
     * as well as datasets with duplicate elements.
     * It aims to minimize the number of comparisons and data movements while providing good worst-case time complexity.<br><br>
     * The time complexity of Tim Sort is O(n log n) in the worst case. This occurs when the input data is in reverse order or has no pre-existing order.
     * In practice, Tim Sort often performs better than the worst-case time complexity due to its ability to efficiently handle partially sorted and duplicate elements.<br><br>
     * Tim Sort's ability to handle different types of input data, its stability, and its worst-case time complexity of <em>O(n log(n))</em>
     * make it a widely used and reliable sorting algorithm in many programming languages and applications.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(n)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>Yes</b>

     *     <li>Inside the loop, the least significant bit of {@code n} is obtained using the bitwise AND operator {@code &} with <i>1</i> {@code (n & 1)}.
     *     The result is then combined with {@code r} using the bitwise OR operator {@code |} {@code (r |= (n & 1))}.
     *     This operation sets the least significant bit of {@code r} to the same value as the least significant bit of {@code n}.</li>
     *     <li>Next, {@code n} is right-shifted by <i>1</i> {@code (n >>= 1)}, effectively dividing it by <i>2</i>.
     *     This is done to gradually reduce the value of n in each iteration until it becomes smaller than {@code MIN_MERGE}.</li>
     *     <li>Finally, outside the loop, the value of {@code n} is added to {@code r (n + r)},
     *     and the result is returned as the minimum run length.</li>
     * </ul>
     * {@code minRunLength} method calculates the minimum run length based on the input value {@code n} by repeatedly dividing {@code n} by <i>2</i> until it becomes smaller than {@code MIN_MERGE}.
     * The least significant bit of each division is stored in {@code r}, and at the end, {@code r} is added to the remaining value of {@code n} to obtain the final minimum run length.
     * @param       n the minimum run length based on the input value.
     * @return      the result as the minimum run length.
