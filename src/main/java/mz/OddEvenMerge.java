     * <b>Odd-even Merge Sort:</b><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * Odd-even Merge Sort algorithm is a parallel sorting algorithm that is based on the concept of odd-even transposition sorting.
     * It works by repeatedly comparing and swapping adjacent elements in pairs until the entire array is sorted.<br>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Divide the array: The array is divided into two halves.
     *     The odd-indexed elements are considered in the first half,
     *     and the even-indexed elements are considered in the second half.</li>
     *     <li>Sort the halves: Both halves are sorted independently using the same odd-even merge sort algorithm.</li>
     *     <li>Merge the sorted halves: The sorted halves are merged by comparing and swapping adjacent elements in pairs.
     *     The odd-indexed elements of the first half are compared with their corresponding even-indexed elements in the second half.
     *     If an element in the first half is greater than the corresponding element in the second half, they are swapped.</li>
     *     <li>Repeat until sorted: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated recursively until the entire array is sorted.
     *     This involves repeatedly dividing the array into halves, sorting them, and merging them back together.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * The odd-even merge sort algorithm takes advantage of the parallelism available in certain hardware architectures,
     * where pairs of adjacent elements can be compared and swapped simultaneously.
     * By sorting and merging the odd and even elements separately,
     * the algorithm exploits this parallelism and improves the sorting performance.<br><br>
     * It's important to note that the odd-even merge sort algorithm has a complexity of <em>O(n^2)</em> in the worst case,
     * where n is the number of elements in the array.
     * However, it can achieve better performance on parallel architectures due to its parallel nature.<br><br>
     * Stability: Odd-even merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm.
     * This means that the relative order of elements with equal values is preserved after sorting.
     * If two elements have the same value, the algorithm ensures that their original order is maintained in the sorted array.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(n)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>Yes</b>
