     * <b>Quick Sort 3-Way:</b><br>
     * Quick Sort 3-Way in simple QuickSort algorithm, we select an element as pivot,
     * partition the array around a pivot and recur for subarrays on the left and right of the pivot.
     * Simple Quick Sort, we fix only one 4 and recursively process remaining occurrences.
     * The idea of 3 way Quick Sort is to process all occurrences of the pivot.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Choose a pivot element from the array.
     *     This can be done in various ways, such as selecting the {@code left}, {@code right} element.</li>
     *     <li>Partition the array into two sub-arrays:
     *     one with elements less than the pivot and another with elements greater than the pivot.
     *     The pivot should be in its final sorted position.</li>
     *     <li>Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays, until the entire array is sorted.</li>
     *     <li>The base case of the recursion is when a sub-array has fewer than two elements,
     *     in which case it is already considered sorted.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * Quicksort has an average-case time complexity of <em>O(n log(n))</em> and performs well in practice.
     * It is widely used and is considered one of the fastest general-purpose sorting algorithms.
     * The average number of recursive calls made to the quicksort function is <em>log(n)</em>,
     * and every time the function is called we are traversing the given array/list which requires <em>O(N)</em> time.
     * Thus, the total time complexity is <em>O(n log(n))</em>.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(log(n))</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>No</b>
