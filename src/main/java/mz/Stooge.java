     * <b>Stooge Sort:</b><br>
     * Is a recursive sorting algorithm that works by recursively sorting the first two-thirds and last two-thirds
     * of the array until the array is sorted. It is similar to other divide-and-conquer algorithms, but its division ratio is
     * unique, dividing the array into three parts instead of two.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>If the element at the left index is greater than the element at the right index, swap them.</li>
     *     <li>Calculate the size of one-third of the subarray.</li>
     *     <li>If the subarray size is 2 or smaller, the array is already sorted (base case), and no further action is needed.</li>
     *     <li>Recursively apply Stooge sort to the first two-thirds of the array </li>
     *     <li>Recursively apply Stooge sort to the last two-thirds of the array </li>
     *     <li>Recursively apply Stooge sort again to the first two-thirds of the </li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * The time complexity of Stooge sort is <em>O(n^(log 3/log 1.5))</em>. This makes it highly inefficient compared to
     * other sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort, which have better average and worst-case time complexities.<br><br>
     * Stability in sorting algorithms refers to whether equal elements maintain their relative order after sorting.
     * Unfortunately, Stooge sort is not a stable sorting algorithm. It means that the order of equal elements may change
     * during the sorting process, leading to an unstable result. The swapping operations in Stooge sort may disrupt the
     * relative order of equal elements.<br><br>
     * Stooge sort is a unique and interesting sorting algorithm, but it is generally not used in practical applications
     * due to its inefficiency. However, understanding its recursive nature and the divide-and-conquer approach can provide
     * valuable insights into the principles of sorting algorithms.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n^(log 3/log 1.5))</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n^(log 3/log 1.5))</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n^(log 3/log 1.5))</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(log(n))</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>No</b>
