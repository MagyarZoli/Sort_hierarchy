     * <b>Stable Quick Sort:</b><br>
     * Is an extension of the QuickSort algorithm that aims to preserve
     * the relative order of elements with equal values during the sorting process.
     * In a standard QuickSort algorithm, the order of equal elements may change, making it an unstable sorting algorithm.
     * Stable QuickSort addresses this limitation by introducing additional steps to maintain stability.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Select a pivot element: The first step is to choose a pivot element from the array.
     *     The pivot can be selected in various ways, such as picking the first, last, or middle element.</li>
     *     <li>Partitioning: The array is partitioned into two subarrays based on the pivot element.
     *     One subarray contains elements smaller than the pivot,
     *     while the other subarray contains elements greater than the pivot.
     *     The partitioning step ensures that the pivot element is in its final sorted position.</li>
     *     <li>Recursion: Recursively apply Stable QuickSort to the two subarrays created in the previous step.
     *     This step involves selecting a new pivot element for each subarray and performing partitioning until
     *     the subarrays reach a size of <i>1</i> or <i>0</i>, as these subarrays are considered already sorted.</li>
     *     <li>Concatenation: Once the recursion is complete, the sorted subarrays are concatenated to obtain the final sorted array.
     *     The order of concatenation is crucial to maintaining stability.
     *     The elements from the left subarray, which are smaller or equal to the pivot,
     *     should appear before the elements from the right subarray, which are greater than the pivot.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * By carefully handling the partitioning and concatenation steps,
     * Stable QuickSort ensures that elements with equal values remain in their original relative order after sorting.
     * This makes it a stable sorting algorithm.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(log(n))</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>Yes</b>
