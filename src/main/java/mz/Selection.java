     * <b>Selection Sort:</b><br>
     * Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest)
     * element from the unordered part of the list and moving it to the ordered part of the list. The algorithm repeatedly
     * selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unordered part of the list and swaps it with the first element in
     * the unordered part. This process is repeated for the remaining unordered part of the list until the entire list is sorted.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b><br>
     * <em>n</em> - array length<br>
     * <em>i</em> - is the element that is the first element of the unordered part<br>
     * <em>j</em> - is an element that is one of the selected elements of the unordered array part.
     * <dl>
     *     <dt><em>i</em>, <em>j</em>, comparing elements:<br></dt>
     *     <dd>- <em>i</em> is smaller than <em>j</em> elements in the unordered part of the array, then <em>i</em> remains in its existing place and moves to the ordered part.</dd>
     *     <dd>- <em>i</em> is greater than one of the next <em>j</em> elements in the unordered part of the array, then <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> are exchanged and the first unordered element is moved to the ordered part.</dd>
     * </dl>
     * <dl>
     *     <dt>Walks through the array based on the number of <em>n</em> elements:</dt>
     *     <dd>- When it goes through the elements of the array, it replaces the desired elements by then and is done.</dd>
     * </dl>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Time Complexity: <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space: <em>O(1)</em>
