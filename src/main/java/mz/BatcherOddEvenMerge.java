     * <b>Batcher's Odd-even Merge Sort:</b><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * Is a parallel sorting algorithm that combines the odd-even transposition sort and
     * the batcher's merge algorithm to achieve efficient sorting.
     * It is designed to take advantage of parallel processing capabilities in order to speed up the sorting process.<br>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Divide the array: The algorithm begins by dividing the input array into smaller subarrays.
     *     Each subarray is assigned to a processing element or a thread for parallel processing.</li>
     *     <li>Odd-even transposition sort: Within each processing element, the subarray is sorted using the odd-even transposition sort algorithm.
     *     This algorithm compares and swaps adjacent elements in pairs,
     *     iteratively performing odd-even comparisons and transpositions until the subarray is sorted locally.</li>
     *     <li>Odd-even merge: After the odd-even transposition sort phase, the sorted subarrays need to be merged to obtain the globally sorted array.
     *     This is done using the batcher's merge algorithm, which merges pairs of adjacent subarrays in a parallel manner.</li>
     *     <li>Recursive merge: The merging step is performed recursively until all subarrays are merged into a single sorted array.
     *     This process involves repeatedly merging adjacent pairs of subarrays until the final sorted array is obtained.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * The Odd-even Merge Sort algorithm leverages parallelism by sorting and merging subarrays concurrently.
     * This parallelism can be achieved using multiple processing elements, threads, or parallel computing techniques.<br><br>
     * Batcher's odd-even merge sort has a complexity of <em>O(n log^2(n))</em>, where n is the number of elements in the input array.
     * It offers better scalability and potential speedup compared to traditional sorting algorithms
     * like quicksort or mergesort when executed on parallel computing architectures.<br><br>
     * It's worth noting that the efficiency and performance of Batcher's Odd-even Merge Sort
     * depend on factors such as the underlying parallel processing capabilities,
     * the size of the input array, and the specific implementation details of the algorithm and its supporting operations.<br><br>
     * Stability: Batcher's Odd-even Merge Sort is a stable sorting algorithm.
     * This means that it preserves the relative order of elements with equal values during the sorting process.
     * If there are multiple elements with the same value,
     * the algorithm ensures that their original order is maintained in the sorted output.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n log^2(n))</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n log^2(n))</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n log^2(n))</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(n)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>Yes</b>

    /**
     * {@code batcherMerging} method takes an array {@code array} of type {@link java.lang.Comparable Comparable},
     * three integer parameters {@code left}, {@code mid}, and {@code right},
     * and an instance of {@code SortFunctional<Comparable>} as parameters.
     * <ul>
     *     <li>It starts by calculating the length {@code n} of the subarray to be merged, which is {@code (right - left)}.</li>
     *     <li>It initializes three variables {@code i}, {@code j}, and {@code k} with the values of {@code left}, {@code mid}, and <i>0</i> respectively.
     *     These variables will be used as indices for merging and populating the merged array.</li>
     *     <li>It creates a new array {@code merged} of type {@code Comparable} with a length {@code n} to store the merged elements.</li>
     *     <li>It creates a new instance of {@code SortFunctional<Comparable>} called {@code functionalAddEquals}
     *     by calling the {@code functionalComparableToAddEquals} method, passing the {@code functional} instance as a parameter.</li>
     *     <li>The method enters a {@code while} loop that continues as long as {@code i} is less than {@code mid} and {@code j} is less than {@code right}.
     *     This loop performs the merging of elements from the two halves of the subarray based on
     *     the comparison logic defined by the {@code functionalAddEquals} instance.</li>
     *     <li>If the comparison between {@code array[j]} and {@code array[i]} using the {@code functionalAddEquals} instance returns {@code true},
     *     indicating that {@code array[j]} is greater or equal to {@code array[i]},
     *     the element {@code array[i]} is added to the {@code merged} array, and {@code i} and {@code k} are incremented.</li>
     *     <li>If the comparison returns {@code false},
     *     indicating that {@code array[i]} is greater than {@code array[j]},
     *     the element {@code array[j]} is added to the {@code merged} array, and {@code j} and {@code k} are incremented.</li>
     *     <li>After the first {@code while} loop, there may be remaining elements in either the left or right subarray.
     *     Two additional {@code while} loops handle the remaining elements:</li>
     *     <li>The first {@code while} loop runs while {@code i} is less than {@code mid},
     *     indicating that there are still elements in the left subarray.
     *     It adds these remaining elements to the {@code merged} array and increments {@code i} and {@code k}.</li>
     *     <li>The second {@code while} loop runs while {@code j} is less than {@code right},
     *     indicating that there are still elements in the {@code right} subarray.
     *     It adds these remaining elements to the {@code merged} array and increments {@code j} and {@code k}.</li>
     *     <li>Once all elements are merged and stored in the {@code merged} array,
     *     the method updates the corresponding elements in the original {@code array} from indices {@code (left + m)}
     *     with the values of {@code merged[m]} using a {@code for} loop.</li>
     *     <li>The last {@code for} loop iterates through the odd indices from {@code (left + 1)} to {@code (right - 1)}
     *     and checks if adjacent elements need to be swapped based on the comparison logic defined by the {@code functional} instance.
     *     If the comparison returns {@code true}, the {@code swap} method</li>
     * </ul>
     * {@code batcherMerging} method performs the merging step of the Batcher's odd-even merge sorting algorithm.
     * It merges two sorted halves of a subarray and updates the original array accordingly.
     * It uses the {@code functionalAddEquals} instance to compare elements and the {@code functional} instance
     * to check for swaps during the final step of the merging process.
     * @param       array to be arranged.
     * @param       left specific range of the array.
     * @param       mid the middle value of the specified range of the array.
     * @param       right specific range of the array.
     * @param       functional lambda expression for comparison.
     * @see         mz.Sort#functionalComparableToAddEquals(SortFunctional)
