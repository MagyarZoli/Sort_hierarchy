     * <b>Weave Merge Sort:</b><br>
     * Is a variation of the Merge Sort algorithm that aims to achieve better performance by reducing the number of array copies during the merging step.
     * In Weave Merge Sort, instead of creating a new merged array, the merging process is performed directly on the original array.
     * This is achieved by using additional subarrays,
     * left array and right array, to store the elements from the original array temporarily.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>The method takes an array, a left index, and a right index as parameters.</li>
     *     <li>It calculates the size of the range to be sorted and stores it in the variable {@code n}.</li>
     *     <li>If the size {@code n} is less than or equal to <i>1</i>, the range is already sorted, so the method returns.</li>
     *     <li>Otherwise, it calculates the middle index of the range and stores it in the variable mid.</li>
     *     <li>Two new subarrays, left Array and right Array, are created using {@link java.util.Arrays#copyOfRange(Object[], int, int) Arrays.copyOfRange}.
     *     left Array contains the elements from the array parameter starting from the left index up to (but not including) the middle index.
     *     right Array contains the elements from the middle index up to (but not including) the right index.</li>
     *     <li>The method then calls itself recursively twice. The first recursive call sorts the left subarray by passing the range from the left index to the middle index.
     *     The second recursive call sorts the right subarray by passing the range from the middle index to the right index.</li>
     *     <li>After the recursive calls, passing the original array, left Array, and right Array as parameters.
     *     This helper method performs the merging step by comparing elements from left Array and right Array and placing them in the correct order in the original array.</li>
     *     <li>The recursion continues until the base case is reached, which occurs when the range to be sorted has a size of <i>1</i> or less.
     *     At this point, the recursive calls stop, and the sorting process is complete.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * By performing the merging step directly on the original array, Weave Merge Sort eliminates the need for creating
     * a new merged array at each recursion level, reducing the number of array copies and potentially improving the performance of the sorting algorithm.<br><br>
     * It's important to note that the efficiency of the Weave Merge Sort algorithm is still determined
     * by the same asymptotic complexity as the standard Merge Sort algorithm, which is <em>O(n log(n))</em>
     * in the average and worst cases, where n is the number of elements in the array.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(n)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>Yes</b>
