     * <b>Wiki Sort:</b><br>
     * Also known as Block Merge Sort, is an efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm designed to improve upon the performance.
     * Wiki Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that it preserves the relative order of elements with equal values.
     * It achieves a time complexity of <em>O(n log(n))</em> in the worst case.<br><br>
     * The key idea behind Wiki Sort is to use a divide-and-conquer approach to sort the array.
     * It divides the array into blocks of elements and sorts each block independently.
     * Then it repeatedly merges the blocks together until the entire array is sorted.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Divide the input array into blocks of a fixed size (often chosen based on the cache size or other hardware considerations).</li>
     *     <li>Sort each block individually using an efficient sorting algorithm, such as Insertion Sort or another divide-and-conquer algorithm.</li>
     *     <li>Merge adjacent pairs of blocks together, repeatedly merging until only one block remains.</li>
     *     <li>Perform a final merge pass to merge the remaining blocks until the entire array is sorted.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * The merging process in Wiki Sort is where it differs from other sorting algorithms.
     * It uses a clever technique called to efficiently merge the blocks together.
     * Instead of comparing and merging individual elements, it works with entire blocks,
     * reducing the number of comparisons and improving cache efficiency.<br><br>
     * Wiki Sort's performance benefits come from its ability to exploit the data locality of modern computer architectures.
     * By dividing the array into blocks and sorting them independently,
     * it minimizes data movement between levels of the memory hierarchy and takes advantage of cache locality.<br><br>
     * Wiki Sort is a highly efficient and practical sorting algorithm that offers better performance than some traditional sorting algorithms.
     * Its design incorporates techniques to optimize cache usage and minimize the number of comparisons,
     * making it particularly useful for sorting large arrays or datasets with repeated elements.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(n)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>Yes</b>
