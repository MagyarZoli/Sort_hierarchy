     * <b>Comb Sort:</b><br>
     * Is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that is an improvement over Bubble Sort.
     * It works by repeatedly comparing and swapping elements with a specific gap value, gradually reducing the gap until it reaches 1,
     * at which point the algorithm performs a final pass similar to Bubble Sort.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Start with an unsorted list of elements.</li>
     *     <li>Initialize the gap value as the length of the list.</li>
     *     <li>Repeat the following steps until the gap becomes 1:</li>
     *     <ul>
     *         <li>Calculate the new gap value by dividing the current gap by a shrink factor, typically around<br>
     *         <em>1.3 (commonly denoted as 1.3 or 1.3-sqrt(2))</em>.</li>
     *         <li>If the new gap value is less than 1, set it to 1 to ensure a final pass with a gap of 1.</li>
     *         <li>Perform a pass through the list, comparing elements that are {@code gap} positions apart
     *         and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.</li>
     *         <li>Continue moving through the list with the specified gap until reaching the end of the list.</li>
     *     </ul>
     *     <li>Once the gap becomes 1, perform a final pass similar to Bubble Sort, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if necessary.</li>
     *     <li>The sorted list is obtained once the final pass is completed.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * The key idea behind Comb Sort is to eliminate the "turtle" effect in Bubble Sort,
     * where small elements at the end of the list take a long time to move towards their correct positions.
     * By gradually reducing the gap, Comb Sort helps bring such elements closer to their correct positions earlier in the sorting process.<br><br>
     * Comb Sort has a time complexity of <em>O(n^2)</em> in the worst case,
     * but it can be improved to have an average time complexity of <em>O(n log(n))</em> by using an optimal shrink factor.<br><br>
     * Comb Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it requires only a constant amount of additional memory beyond the original list.
     * It is relatively easy to implement and can be useful in certain scenarios where simplicity and memory efficiency are priorities.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n^2 / 2^p)</em> where <em>p</em> is the number of increments<br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(1)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>Yes</b>
