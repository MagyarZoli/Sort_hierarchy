     * <b>Counting Sort:</b><br> You can only sort with whole numbers!
     * Is a non-comparison based sorting algorithm that sorts elements based on their numeric values.
     * It works by determining, for each element in the input array, the number of elements that are smaller than it.
     * With this information, it can then determine the correct position of each element in the sorted output array.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Find the maximum element in the input array and determine its value.
     *     Let's call this maximum value "k".</li>
     *     <li>Create a count array of size k+1, initialized with all elements set to 0. This count array
     *     will be used to store the frequency of each distinct element in the input array.</li>
     *     <li>Iterate through the input array and increment the corresponding count in the count array for each element encountered.
     *     This step essentially counts the number of occurrences of each element.</li>
     *     <li>Modify the count array by adding the previous count to the current count at each index.
     *     This modification allows the count array to store the starting position of each element in the sorted output array.</li>
     *     <li>Create a sorted output array of the same size as the input array.</li>
     *     <li>Iterate through the input array in reverse order.
     *     For each element encountered, find its corresponding position in the sorted output array using the count array.
     *     Place the element in the sorted output array at the determined position and decrement the count in the count array.</li>
     *     <li>The sorted output array now contains the elements in the input array sorted in non-decreasing order.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * Counting Sort has a time complexity of <em>O(n + k)</em>, where n is the number of elements in the input array and k is the range of the input values.
     * It is most effective when the range of input values is relatively small compared to the number of elements.
     * However, it requires additional memory space for the count array, which makes it less practical for large ranges of input values.<br><br>
     * Counting Sort is stable, meaning it preserves the relative order of elements with equal values.
     * It is often used as a subroutine in other sorting algorithms or when sorting elements with known ranges,
     * such as non-negative integers.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n+k)</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n+k)</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n+k)</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(max)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>Yes</b>
