     * <b>Shell Sort:</b><br>
     * Is an efficient sorting algorithm that is an extension of Insertion Sort.
     * It addresses one of the limitations of Insertion Sort,
     * which is the excessive shifting of elements when dealing with small elements towards the end of the array.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Start with an unsorted array of elements.</li>
     *     <li>Choose a gap sequence, which is a series of decreasing integers.
     *     Common gap sequences include
     *     the <i>Knuth</i> sequence <em>(3^k - 1) / 2</em>and the <i>Sedgewick</i> sequence <em>(4^k + 3 * 2^(k-1) + 1)</em>.</li>
     *     <li>Iterate over the gap sequence, performing Insertion Sort on each subarray with the chosen gap.</li>
     *     <li>For each gap, divide the array into multiple subarrays, where the elements in each subarray are at a distance of the gap.</li>
     *     <li>Apply Insertion Sort to each subarray independently.</li>
     *     <li>Decrease the gap and repeat steps 4-5 until the gap becomes 1.</li>
     *     <li>Finally, apply Insertion Sort with a gap of 1 to sort the array completely.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * The key idea behind Shell Sort is to sort the array in a way that allows for efficient shifting of elements across larger gaps.
     * By sorting the array in stages using different gap sizes, Shell Sort gradually reduces the amount of shifting needed,
     * leading to a more efficient sorting process.<br><br>
     * Shell Sort has a time complexity that depends on the chosen gap sequence.
     * It can have an average-case time complexity of <em>O(n log(n)^2)</em> or better,
     * which makes it faster than simple quadratic sorting algorithms like Insertion Sort or Selection Sort.<br><br>
     * Shell Sort is an in-place algorithm, meaning it does not require additional memory beyond the original array.
     * It is widely used for medium-sized arrays or as a sub-routine in more advanced sorting algorithms.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n log(n)^2)</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(1)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>No</b>
