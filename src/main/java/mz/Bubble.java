     * <b>Bubble Sort:</b><br>
     * Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
     * It works by repeatedly "bubbling" the largest (or smallest) element to its correct position in each iteration.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Start with an unsorted array of elements.</li>
     *     <li>Compare each pair of adjacent elements starting from the beginning of the array.</li>
     *     <li>If the elements are in the wrong order (e.g., the current element is greater than the next element for ascending order), swap them.</li>
     *     <li>Move to the next pair of adjacent elements and repeat steps 2-3.</li>
     *     <li>After the first pass, the largest (or smallest) element will be in its correct position at the end of the array.</li>
     *     <li>Repeat steps 2-5 for the remaining elements (excluding the last sorted element) until the entire array is sorted.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * Bubble Sort gets its name from the way smaller (or larger) elements "bubble" to their correct positions during each iteration.
     * In each pass, the largest (or smallest) element gradually moves towards the end (or beginning) of the array.<br><br>
     * Bubble Sort has a time complexity of <em>O(n^2)</em> in the average and worst cases. It is not considered an efficient sorting
     * algorithm for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity. However, it has the advantage of simplicity
     * and ease of implementation.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n)</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(1)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>Yes</b>
