/**
 * Intro Sort is a hybrid sorting algorithm that combines the strengths of Quick Sort and Insertion Sort.
 * It aims to provide fast average-case performance while maintaining worst-case guarantees.
 * The basic idea behind Intro Sort is to start with Quick Sort, which is known for its efficiency on average,
 * but has a worst-case time complexity of <em>O(n^2)</em> in certain scenarios.
 * To mitigate the risk of Quick Sort's worst-case behavior, Intro Sort monitors the recursion depth during the sorting process.
 * If the depth exceeds a certain threshold, the algorithm switches to HeapSort,
 * which guarantees worst-case <em>O(n log(n))</em> time complexity but has higher overhead.
 * Additionally, for small subarrays, IntroSort switches to Insertion Sort, which has good performance for small input sizes.
 * @param       <T> setting of a type based on which the elements can be sorted.
 * @since       1.0
