     * <b>Intro Pancake Sort:</b><br>
     * Is a hybrid sorting algorithm that combines the strengths of Quick Sort and Pancake Sort.
     * It aims to provide fast average-case performance while maintaining worst-case guarantees.
     * The basic idea behind Intro Sort is to start with Quick Sort, which is known for its efficiency on average,
     * but has a worst-case time complexity of <em>O(n^2)</em> in certain scenarios.<br><br>
     * To mitigate the risk of Quick Sort's worst-case behavior, Intro Sort monitors the recursion depth during the sorting process.
     * If the depth exceeds a certain threshold, the algorithm switches to
     * Another Sort is Pancake Sort.
     * Implements an adaptive sorting algorithm called Intro Sort Interface.<br><br>
     * <b>Example:</b>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>This condition checks if the size of the subarray is greater than {@code INTRO_SIZE}.
     *     If true, the array is large enough to be sorted using QuickSort.</li>
     *     <li>This condition checks if the maximum depth has been reached.
     *     If true, the maximum depth has been exceeded,
     *     and the sorting algorithm switches to another sorting method is Pancake Sort</li>
     *     <li>If the maximum depth has been reached, the sort the subarray using a different sorting algorithm.</li>
     *     <li>If the maximum depth has not been reached,
     *     the to perform the partitioning step of QuickSort.
     *     It returns the index of the pivot element.</li>
     *     <li>The recursively called on the left subarray (elements smaller than the pivot) to further sort it.</li>
     *     <li>The recursively called on the right subarray (elements greater than the pivot) to further sort it.</li>
     *     <li>Else the size of the subarray is not greater than {@code INTRO_SIZE}, the array is considered small, and the
     *     perform insertion sort on the subarray.</li>
     *     <li>This is a abstract method declaration.
     *     It appears to be a separate sorting algorithm that is called when the maximum depth is reached.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <b>Note:</b><br>
     * Implements an adaptive sorting algorithm called Intro Sort. It combines the Quick Sort
     * algorithm with a switch to another sorting algorithm Pancake Sort when the recursion depth exceeds a specified threshold {@code maxDepth}.
     * The purpose of this adaptive approach is to optimize performance by leveraging the strengths of different sorting algorithms depending on the input size.<br><br>
     * <b>Property:</b><br>
     * Worst Case Complexity:   <em>O(n^2)</em><br>
     * Best Case Complexity:    <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Average Case Complexity: <em>O(n log(n))</em><br>
     * Auxiliary Space:         <em>O(n)</em><br>
     * Stability:               <b>No</b>
